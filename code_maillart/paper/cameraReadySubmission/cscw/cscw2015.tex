%It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience.  Please read
%previous years' Proceedings to understand the writing style and
%conventions that successful authors have used.  It is particularly
%important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
%you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
%published work, i.e., what is the unique contribution that your work
%makes to the field?  Please consider what the reader will learn from
%your submission, and how they will find your work useful.  If you
%write with these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be
%successful, both in being accepted into the Conference, and in
%influencing the work of our field.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:
%
% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-
% in-an-ieee-paper-if-using-bibtex
%
% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
