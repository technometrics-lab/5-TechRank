% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%\begin{abstract}
%We introduce a new method to jointly rank the quality of articles and the expertise
% of editors in Categories of Wikipedia, based on the bi-partite network information 
% of who has contributed at least once to an article on the one hand, and what are 
% the articles that have edited at least once by a given author on the other hand.
%  We show that this ``reflexive" ranking method exhibits high correlations with 
%  usual article quality and user expertise metrics, which account for quality on 
%  Wikipedia (that we assume to be a grand truth here). In particular, we find that 
%  the quality of an article can be captured very well by our method right after a few 
%  edits, while the expertise of editors is captured increasingly better over time. 
%  Our results suggest that it is easier to predict the quality of an article from the 
%  editors who touched it, rather than editor expertise from articles they have 
%  edited.

%Theory of ranking  \cite{Blumm2012}

%\subsection{criticism of alternative economy}
%we are not really saying much about how the economy of wikipedia, i.e. inputs and outputs.
%
%but still we can say something about the fact peer production, is indeed different from tradition economy.
%
%but still might be useful to justify why we are using HH model, and what we expect as differences. 

%\subsection{criticism of improving rankings approach}
%no reliable metrics for ranking people, there is never a benchmark to say that we have a "BETTER" metric in terms of measuring quality, precisely because we use those to calibrate.

%but still can say it is an effecient alternative metric, 

%\subsection{issue of possible overfitting}
%how do we justify the existence of alpha and beta as the parameters we calibrate

\input{sections/related_work.tex}

\input{sections/method2.tex}

%With some imagination Wikipedia, and many other online collaborative projects can be viewed as such a market. (Here we only consider English Wikipedia). We consider Wikipedia Editors to be our "countries", and Wikipedia Articles to be "products". Therefore a country producing a product is interpreted as an editor editing an article. We also inherit the assumption that the better editors will be those who edit the rarer articles, although we re-adjust that assumption in instructive ways later on. 


%2. We develop a new measure for the degree of collaborativity of category.

%Questions. Can this economics theory be applied, into other "economies"? Which is the other side of a Wikipedia question, which is "What are better ways to rank Wikipedia editor and articles, since the flawed Edit Counts and Article Metrics, are used as proxies"?

%For each snapshot, we constructed the matrix $\mathbf{M_{e,a}}$ of contributors versus edited articles, similar to the country versus products matrix of the Economics Domain. For each snapshot, the values in $\mathbf{M_{e,a}}$ are defined as the number of edits made by editor $e$ on article $a$ in the category occurring in the snapshot time. Note that the final snapshot represents the entire history of the category up to the present date. 

%\subsection{Interpretation of w* algorithm in the context of open collaboration}
%
%To understand the results, we must have a firm grasp on what $\alpha$ and $\beta$ mean. They are more easily understood by roughly rewriting $\mathbf{w^*}$ as:
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{cases}
%w^{*}_{e} \sim k^{1-\beta}_{e} \langle k_{a}^{-\alpha}\rangle_e \\
%
%w^{*}_{a} \sim k^{1-\alpha}_{a} \langle k_{e}^{-\beta}\rangle_a
%\end{cases}
%\end{equation}
%
%where $\langle k_{a}^{-\alpha}\rangle_e$ is the arithmetic average of k  $k_{a}^{-\alpha}$. 
%
%Since we see beta and alpha are close to being additive inverses, we can just study what it means for them to increase and decrease.
%
%For Editors.
%As beta approaches one from infinity then editors are less judge by their the amount of contributions and more about the quality of the articles they contribute to. As beta becomes more negative below one, then the amount of articles is more important in predicting success.  So 'gnomier' editors are more successful in this case. So we can see beta as a style marker for a category.
%
%The lower beta, the more a diversified editor will be successful in a Category, and the higher beta, the more a targeted quality-writing author will be successful.
%
%

%How this would used in an setting
%
%\subsection{How do w* algorithm should behave in open collaboration (theory)}
%
%It might be opposite or negative.
%
%\subsection{Data}
%1. The current investigation involved collecting historical data of edition and quality metrics, from 10 categories of articles in English Wikipedia, with focus on fine-grained edits by contributors to articles.
%
%2. The chosen categories contain between 50 and 4000 articles, and between 50 and 5000 contributors have edited at least 100,000 times all the articles over their history. (c.f. table \ref{tab:statistics} for summary statistics on the categories). 
%
%3. For each category, we constructed 10 accumulative snapshots, that is each starting from the first edit in the category until 10\% more of the categories total edits have occurred. \ref{fig:accumulative_snapshots}
%
%
% For each snapshot, we constructed the matrix $\mathbf{M_{e,a}}$ of contributors versus edited articles, similar to the country versus products matrix of the Economics Domain. For each snapshot, the values in $\mathbf{M_{e,a}}$ are defined as the number of edits made by editor $e$ on article $a$ in the category occurring in the snapshot time. Note that the final snapshot represents the entire history of the category up to the present date.
%
%
%The matrix $\mathbf{\hat{M}_{e,a}}$ is a binary representation of $\mathbf{M_{e,a}}$ where each nonzero entry is replaced with $1$. This represents if editors have touched which articles rather than how much they have touched each article. In the economics domain, the distinction of making a binary matrix out of the data is interpreted an alternative metric to GDP per capita, rather than GDP. Here we could also see the distinction as normalized editor fitness.
%
%
%The output of $\mathbf{w^*}$ are a pair of rankings $ w^*_e$ and $ w^*_a$ for editors and articles respectively.
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{cases}
%w^*_e = A(\sum^{N_a}_{a=1} M_{e,a}k_a^{-\alpha})k_e^{-\beta} \\
%w^*_a = B(\sum^{N_e}_{e=1} M_{e,a}k_e^{-\beta})k_a^{-\alpha}
%\end{cases}
%\end{equation}
%
%Next we collect exogenous metrics as comparison for both  $w^{*}_{e}$ and $w^{*}_{a}$, which we call  $v_e$ and $v_a$.







%\section{Discussion}
%
%6. {\it Refer to problems here, if any.}
%
%
%The exogenous metric for editors $v_e$ we take is $labour hours$. For each editor the contribution history upto the snapshot point,  divide into strings of $edit sessions$, edits that occur within 1 hour of the previous edit. Then $labour hours$ are determined by subtracting the looking at the total time between the first and last edit in each edit session, and then summing the labours of each edit session. \cite{Geiger, Halfaker}. 
%
%For an exogenous measure of article quality, $ v_a$,  we use a group of 5 text analysis metrics performed on Wikipedia articles at the lastest time in the snapshot. These are ratio of mark-up to readable text, number of headings, article length, citations per article length, and outgoing intrawiki links. To reduce the dimensionality of these 5 metrics, we perform Principal Component Analysis, and accept the principal component. Variance explained by the first principal component, was as high as .7 and never below .5 http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~morten/publications/wikisym2013-tellmemore.pdf, http://mailer.fsu.edu/~bstvilia/papers/quantWiki.pdf \cite{ Morten}.
%
%
%\subsection{Calibrating}
%
%Having our endogenous and exogenous variables now, we perform a recursive grid search over the two dimensions of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to find a maximum correlation between our rankings from $\mathbf{w^*}$ and our exogenous variables. Our grid search operates on the interval $[-5,5]$ with a resolution of 0.2 in on each axis.
%
%
%We also use a maximizing algorithm to find the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ which maximize the spearman $\rho$ rank correlation between our endogenous and exogenous rankings. This is performed for both of internal users ranks versus labour hours and internal article ranks and aggregated actionable article metrics.
%
%Importantly we search for negative values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which is not done in the Economics Domain.
%
%\subsection{Finding Trends over Snapshots}
%
%The calibration technique for a category is performed at each of the ten points in the snapshot history. This allows us to track trends of $\rho$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ over time.
%
%
%
%5. While the implementation presented here is strictly similar to, the interpretation is slightly different in the context of group collaboration. Indeed, while countries competes for selling products, the hypothesis here is that Wikipedia contributors cooperate, at least in a very informal way, for improving the quality of articles.
