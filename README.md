TECH-RANK algorithm
=======

## Scope
TechRank aims to help decision-makers to quantitatively assess the influence of the entities in order to  take good investments decisions under high level of uncertainty.

### Code structure and usage
The code is a mix of notebooks and `py` files: 
- the _py files_ contain the functions needed in the notebook and the declaration of the classes;
- the _notebooks_ explain all the steps.

**Classes** 

We work with 3 dataclasses: `Companies`, `Technologies` and `Investors`.
In `main.ipynb`, we create the Companies and Technologies objects, while in `investors.ipynb` the Investors instances. All objects are saved as [pickle files](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) in the `classes` folder. 
Please note that the Companies object changes in `investments.ipynb`, so this notebook must be run after `main.ipynb`.
