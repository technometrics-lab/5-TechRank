TECH-RANK algorithm
=======

## Scope

------
### Code structure and usage
The code is a mix of notebooks and py file: 
- the _py files_ contain the functions needed in the notebook and the declaration of the classes;
- the _notebooks_ explain all the steps and work thanks to the py file.

**Classes** 
We work with 3 dataclasses: 'Companies', 'Technologies' and 'Investors'.
In the notebook 'main.ipynb', we create the Companies and Technologies objects, while in 'investors.ipynb' the Investors Instances. All instances are saved as [pickle files](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) in the 'classes' folder. 
Please note that the Companies objects changes in 'investments.ipynb', so this notebook must be run after 'main.ipynb'.
