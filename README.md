TECH-RANK 
=============================================

## Goal

TechRank aims to help decision-makers to quantitatively assess the influence of the entities in order to  take good investments decisions under high level of uncertainty.

## Abstract
The cybersecurity technological landscape is a complex ecosystem in which entities -- such as  companies and technologies -- influence each other in a non-trivial manner. Understanding influence measures of each entity is central when it comes to  take informed technological  investment  decisions. 

To recognize the mutual influence of companies and technologies in cybersecurity, we consider a bi-partite graph that links companies and technologies. Then, we weight nodes by applying a recursive algorithm based on the method of reflection. This endeavour helps to assign a measure of how an entity impacts the cybersecurity market. Our results help (i) to measure the magnitude of influence of each entity, (ii) decision-makers to address more informed investment strategies, according to their preferences. 

Investors can customzse the algorithm by indicating which external factors --such as previous investments and geographical positions-- are relevant for them. They can select their interests among a list of properties about companies and technologies and weights them according to their needs. This preferences are automatically included in the algorithm and the TechRank's scores changes accordingly.

For more information please refer to:
- [the short paper](../docs/_static/TechRank_shortpaper.pdf) (it does not investigate the inclusion of exogenous factors)
- [the master thesis](TechRank_thesis.pdf)

## Code

The code is a mix of notebooks and `py` files: 
- the _py files_ contain the functions needed in the notebook and the declaration of the classes;
- the _notebooks_ explain all the steps.

**Data**:
[Crunchbase (CB) pro](https://www.crunchbase.com/home).

**Classes** :
We work with 3 dataclasses: `Companies`, `Technologies` and `Investors`.

**Documentation**:
We create the documentation in HTML using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

Each file contains more details and comments. 

Please note that data (also the classes) are not available because they are released by Crunchbase to the CYD Campus with a proprietary licence that does not allow us to share them. However, we plovide a sample of the data.
